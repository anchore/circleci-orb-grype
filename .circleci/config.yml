# Pipeline Parameters
## These parameters are used internally by orb-tools. Skip to the Jobs section.
parameters:
  run-integration-tests:
    description: An internal flag to prevent integration test from running before a development version has been created.
    type: boolean
    default: false
  dev-orb-version:
    description: >
      The development version of the orb to test.
      This value is automatically adjusted by the "trigger-integration-tests-workflow" job to correspond with the specific version created by the commit and should not be edited.
      A "dev:alpha" version must exist for the initial pipeline run.
    type: string
    default: "dev:alpha"
